1. INTRODUCTION
This application allows communication with the APRS network via APRS-IS (Internet Service) and directly via a KISS-mode TNC connected to a radio. You can send position/status beacons, direct messages, monitor APRS activity, and set up automatic beacons for either interface. TNC communication is handled in a separate thread to keep the UI responsive and includes error reporting.
2. PREREQUISITES & SETUP
Network: Internet connection required for APRS-IS.
APRS Callsign & Passcode: Needed for APRS-IS transmission.
TNC & Radio: For TNC operation, a KISS-compatible TNC and a configured radio are required.
Serial Port: A serial port (likely USB-to-Serial adapter) to connect to the TNC. Ensure drivers are installed and the correct port is selected in the application.
Dependencies: Python 3, PySide6 (including QtSerialPort).
3. APRS-IS & TNC TAB
3.1. APRS Configuration (Common for IS & TNC)
These settings are used by both APRS-IS and TNC transmission modes:
APRS Callsign-SSID: Your amateur radio callsign and SSID (e.g., N0CALL-9). This is crucial for forming your packets.
Latitude & Longitude (Dec Deg): Your geographical coordinates for position reports.
üí† Select Symbol Button: Choose your APRS symbol.
3.2. APRS-IS Specific Settings
APRS Passcode: Your APRS-IS passcode. Enter -1 for receive-only on APRS-IS.
APRS-IS Server & Port: Address and port of the APRS-IS server (e.g., noam.aprs2.net:14580).
Filter (optional): An APRS filter string for APRS-IS.
Connect/Disconnect APRS-IS Buttons: Manage your connection to the APRS-IS server.
3.3. TNC (KISS Mode) Settings
Serial Port: Select the COM port your TNC is connected to. Click üîÑ to refresh the list if ports are not appearing or have changed.
Baud Rate: Set the baud rate for the serial connection (e.g., 9600, 19200). This must match your TNC's configuration.
Connect/Disconnect TNC Buttons: Manage your serial connection to the TNC.
TNC Status: Displays the current connection status of the TNC. Errors during connection or operation will be shown here and in the Activity Log.
Use TNC for Sending: Check this box to direct outgoing manual sends, DMs, and automatic beacons through the TNC instead of APRS-IS. If unchecked, APRS-IS (if connected) will be used.
3.3.1. Automatic Beacon Settings (Dedicated Text)
Beacon Text: Text for the primary automatic beacon.
Beacon Interval (min): Interval for this beacon.
üîî Enable Beacon / üîï Disable Beacon Button: Toggles this beacon.
3.3.2. Timed Status/Position Beacon (Uses Manual Status Text)
Status/Pos Comment (Manual): Text entered here can be sent manually or as a timed beacon.
Status Beacon Interval (min): Interval for this secondary timed beacon.
üì°üîî Enable Status Beacon / üì°üîï Disable Status Beacon Button: Toggles this beacon.
3.4. Connecting & Sending Data
Manual Send: The "Send Manual Pos/Status" button uses the "Status/Pos Comment (Manual)" field. It sends via APRS-IS or TNC based on the "Use TNC for Sending" checkbox.
Direct Messages: Sent via APRS-IS or TNC based on the "Use TNC for Sending" checkbox.
Automatic Beacons: Sent via APRS-IS or TNC based on the "Use TNC for Sending" checkbox.
Note: For TNC transmission, a valid passcode is not strictly required by the TNC itself, but your callsign must be set. For APRS-IS transmission, a valid passcode (not -1) is needed.
Error Handling: The application provides feedback for TNC connection errors (e.g., port not found, permission denied), write failures, and some protocol issues in the Activity Log and Status Bar.
3.5. APRS Log & Display Customization
Displays incoming APRS packets from APRS-IS (prefixed with [IS]) and TNC (prefixed with [TNC]), plus server/TNC messages.
Customize font size and colors.
3.6. Heard APRS Stations List
Displays stations heard from APRS-IS or TNC. Each item in the list provides a multi-line summary including:
Callsign, Last Heard Time (local), Packet Type (e.g., Position, Status, Generic APRS Data).
Packet Timestamp (if available), Latitude / Longitude, Symbol (for position packets).
Speed, Course, Altitude (if available for position packets).
A snippet of the Comment or Status message.
Single-click on a station in the list to open a dialog showing more detailed decoded information including: Callsign, Last Heard Time, Packet Type, Packet Timestamp, Latitude, Longitude, Symbol, Speed, Course, Altitude, the full Comment/Status, and the Raw Packet Body (which includes destination and path).
Double-click (or select and click "üó∫Ô∏è Track on Map") to track the station on the APRS Map tab.
üßπ Clear List Button: Clears the station list.
4. APRS MAP TAB
Displays APRS data on maps.
5. ACTIVITY LOG (Common Panel)
